While you won’t have to manage a short-term loan as long as other business loans, you’ll need to stay on top of loan payments. For one, short-term loans can come with aggressive repayments, such as a higher payment or rapid schedule like daily or weekly payments. To make all payments, you’ll need to keep a close eye on your business’s cash flow and adjust as needed based on current revenue.

Some short-term loans also work differently than standard business loans. To manage these loans, you should gain a solid understanding of how your particular loan’s fees work. For example, invoice factoring charges a fee based on a percentage of unpaid invoices you used to gain funding. Factoring companies may charge it as a one-time fee, or the percentage may increase the longer your invoices go unpaid.

No matter which short-term loan you choose, keep up with repayments by setting up automatic withdrawals from your bank account. And if you think you’ll miss payments or you’re running into hard times, be upfront with your lender so that you can work out a plan. Lenders could delay payments for a short time or restructure the payments to fit your current finances.
