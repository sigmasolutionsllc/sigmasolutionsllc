To choose the best short-term business loans, we ensured all loans featured are broadly available across the United States, have a minimum term of no longer than 12 months and offer a minimum funding speed of fewer than five days. We then considered features that make loans affordable and accessible to businesses with different characteristics, including interest rates, loan amounts, credit score requirements, minimum annual revenue and fees. We selected a variety of loan types to best serve businesses with differing needs.
