Depending on your credit history and lender requirements, you may have an easier time getting a short-term small business loan with online lenders rather than banks or credit unions. On the plus side, online lenders tend to have more relaxed requirements, more streamlined application processes and faster funding times than traditional financial institutions. But loan amounts are usually smaller and interest rates may be higher.

Banks and credit unions sometimes offer short-term loans, typically term loans or lines of credit. Bank of America and PNC Bank are two banks that offer both, making them a good choice if you are an established business that isnâ€™t needing fast funding.
